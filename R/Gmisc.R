#' A package for plotting, tables, etc. 
#' 
#' This is a collection of functions that I've found useful in my
#' research. The package is inspired and uses many of Frank Harrel's Hmisc
#' package. The functions that I often find crude or lacking are mostly
#' related to conveying data to the common reader. As I work in orthopaedics I
#' can't submit LaTeX files and the conversion between LaTeX and
#' Word/OpenOffice is far from smooth.
