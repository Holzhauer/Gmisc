#' A package for plotting, tables, and basic outputs. 
#' 
#' This is a collection of functions that I've found useful in my research.
#'  The package is inspired by Frank Harrel's Hmisc package. The main focus
#'  is on tables and plots. For tables you'll find the convenient htmlTable
#'  that I have used for advanced table layout. A major focus has been to have
#'  it compatible with LibreOffice (you can copy/past from there into word)
#'  as I generally want to be able to send my documents to a journal in .doc/.docx
#'  format. The three main plots are the transitionPlot, forestplot2, and
#'  plotHR functions. Apart from those you will find a few handy functions for
#'  formatting p-values, generating the basic stats for your table 1, etc.
