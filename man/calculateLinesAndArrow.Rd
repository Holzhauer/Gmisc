\title{Gets offsetted lines}
\usage{
calculateLinesAndArrow(x, y, offset, end_x = -1, end_y = -1,
  arrow_offset = -1)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{A numeric vector containing all the x-elements}
  \item{y}{A numeric vector containing all the y-elements}
  \item{offset}{The offset to add to the line, can be a vector
  if you want to use different offsets.} \item{end_x}{The x
  end of the line where the arrow occurrs (if < 0 arrow is
  skipped)} \item{end_y}{The y end of the line where the arrow
  occurrs (if < 0 arrow is skipped)} \item{arrow_offset}{The
  offset to add to the arrow section if any (if <= 0 arrow is
  skipped)}
}
\value{
\code{list(list(x = ..., y = ...))} Returns a list with
the right/left lines that in turn lists with \emph{x} and
\emph{y} elements
}
\description{
The function calculates new points according to the offset
that lie to the left/right of the provided line.
