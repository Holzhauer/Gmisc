Title: A few handy misc functions for plots, tables, and more
Author: Max Gordon <max@gforge.se>
Maintainer: Max Gordon <max@gforge.se>
Description: This is a collection of functions for tables, plots, and more.
    For tables you'll find the convenient htmlTable that I have used for
    advanced markdown-compatible table layout. A major focus has been to
    have it compatible with LibreOffice and MS Word. The plots are 
    transitionPlot and forestplot2. Apart from those you will find 
    a few handy functions for formatting p-values, generating the 
    basic stats for your table 1, etc.
