Title: A few handy functions of mine
Author: Max Gordon <max@gforge.se>
Maintainer: Max Gordon <max@gforge.se>
Description: This is a collection of functions that I've found useful in my
    research. The package is inspired by Frank Harrel's Hmisc package. The
    functions that I often find crude or lacking are mostly related to
    conveying data to the common reader. As I work in orthopaedics I can't
    submit LaTeX files and the conversion between LaTeX and Word/OpenOffice is
    far from smooth. It also contains visualization tools that I've found
    useful when trying to convey my research.
