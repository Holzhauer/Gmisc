Title: A few plot, table, and misc functions
Author: Max Gordon <max@gforge.se>
Maintainer: Max Gordon <max@gforge.se>
Description: This is a collection of functions that I've found useful in my is
    on tables and plots. For tables you'll find the convenient htmlTable that I
    have used for advanced table layout. A major focus has been to have it
    compatible with LibreOffice (you can copy/past from there into word) as I
    generally want to be able to send my documents to a journal in .doc/.docx
    format. The plots are transitionPlot and forestplot2. Apart from those you
    will find a few handy functions for formatting p-values, generating the
    basic stats for your table 1, etc.
